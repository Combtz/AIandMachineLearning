Your codes must be written in Tensorflow and be executable under Google colab. You will need a GPU access where Google colab gives you such access free of charge. Your report can be written in the same document as your codes in .ipynb file. Every step carries a particular mark indicated in every instruction. Full mark is 140 points."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"78e76d44","metadata":{"id":"78e76d44"},"source":["### 1.
